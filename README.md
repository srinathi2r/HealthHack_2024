### README Length

A README file on GitHub can be as long or as short as necessary to convey the project's details effectively. The key is to balance comprehensiveness with brevity, ensuring that readers can quickly understand what your project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Including the descriptions provided, structured appropriately within the README file, will help achieve this balance without making it unnecessarily long.
